**Update** We could not get the deployment of our wesite to run outside of the local computer it was configured on. The source code for our project from the demo is inclided in VirtualPantryFinal.py, all files are companion files except for VirtualPantry3.py, and FoodKeeper-Data.xls. Userdata.py was our attempt to implement notifications that we were not able to implement.
